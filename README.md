```

### Phase 3: Frontend Development (Frontend + Designer)
```
/agents frontend-engineer ui-designer
Implement the login system frontend based on approved designs:

Technical requirements:
- Framework: React with TypeScript
- Styling: Tailwind CSS + CSS Modules
- State management: Zustand or React Context
- Form handling: React Hook Form + Zod validation
- HTTP client: Axios with interceptors
- Animation: Framer Motion
- Icons: Lucide React

Features to implement:
- Registration form with real-time validation
- Login form with password visibility toggle
- "Forgot Password" flow
- Email verification UI
- Loading states and error handling
- Toast notifications
- Responsive design
- Theme switching

Deliverables:
- Complete React components
- Form validation logic
- API integration layer
- Responsive CSS
- Animation implementations
```

### Phase 4: Backend Implementation (Backend + Security)
```
/agents backend-engineer security-specialist
Implement the backend authentication system:

Tech stack:
- Node.js + Express (or Python + FastAPI)
- PostgreSQL/MongoDB database
- JWT for tokens
- bcrypt for password hashing
- Rate limiting middleware
- Helmet.js for security headers

Endpoints to create:
- POST /api/auth/register
- POST /api/auth/login
- POST /api/auth/logout
- POST /api/auth/refresh
- POST /api/auth/forgot-password
- POST /api/auth/reset-password
- POST /api/auth/verify-email
- GET /api/auth/me

Security implementations:
- Input sanitization
- SQL injection prevention
- CORS configuration
- Rate limiting
- Account lockout
- Password policies

Deliverables:
- Complete API implementation
- Database migrations
- Security middleware
- Error handling
- API documentation
```

### Phase 5: Integration & Testing (QA + All Agents)
```
/agents qa-tester frontend-engineer backend-engineer

## Orchestration Example Usage

```bash
# Start the orchestration
claude

# Initialize project
"I need to build a complete login system. Please orchestrate multiple specialized agents to handle design, frontend, backend, security, and testing. Start with the project orchestrator agent to plan the workflow."

# Follow up with specific phases
"Now activate the UI designer agent to create comprehensive login form designs with modern UX principles."

# Continue coordination
"Bring in the backend architect and security specialist to design the API and security implementation."

# And so on through each phase...
```

This orchestration approach ensures each agent focuses on their expertise while maintaining cohesive integration across the entire login system development lifecycle.
